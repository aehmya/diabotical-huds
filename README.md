Huds for Diabotical

HUD

If you wish to share your HUD you can type /homedir in the console, or go to Documents/Diabotical/Settings.txt 
if you installed in the initial or second day of the beta, otherwise your folder might now be 
C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Diabotical replace username with yours to be able to paste that address in 
the windows explorer address bar (or the custom location of your home folder) then close the game, then Ctrl+F "hud_definition" 
and then you can share that string with others or replace it, it's long for many chat programs/posts so it can 
be easier to use something like https://pastebin.com/ or putting it on a separate txt file or sending people 
the whole settings.txt (though you should remind them not to put it on their folder to not overwrite it) and 
the person that receives that file copy pastes the string to their settings.txt (We would like this process to 
be easier in the future, integrated in-game)

There's a channel on the official Discord for HUD sharing: https://discord.gg/diabotical
